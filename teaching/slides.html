## What do you want to do? 
      
???
You have a few options. You can ignore it, give some Tylenol, ask the nurse for some vitals, get an EKG, get labs, or hold off on anything and just see the patient first.

# Sure...but is this actually helpful?
- According to [Martina et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1497143), most descriptors of chest pain - including **location**, **quality**, and **associated symptoms** have **low predictive value**
- They also reported that most patients won't use the term "pain" to describe what they're feeling
